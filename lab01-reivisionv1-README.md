Lab code and solutions for EECS 111 at Northwestern

Introduction: Using the Tab key as an option for indendation was added

Removing "..." in many examples a ... was included before some instructions however this perevented the program from running
so if students wanted to see if a check expect would pass, they'd be interrupted. This change was implemented for:
  excercise 1
  excercise 2
 
Removing [YOUR CODE HERE], in some examples the intructions said to fill in the ... but also a [YOUR CODE HERE] was included
so having the two place holders seemed a bit redundant, the ... was left instead. This was implemented for:
  excercise 3
  excercise 4
  
Using #| |# to comment large templates, in some of the templates there included an uncommented check expect that could pop up 
early if students want to do check expects, so in examples with large templates the #| |# style of commenting was added
This was implemented for:
  excercise 4
  excercise 5 (the second one)
  
Also there's two excercises with number 5, I'm not sure if that was intentional? I left it for now.

Also for the first exercise 5, the note that the function should calculate maximum area was added to be conistent with
solutions.
